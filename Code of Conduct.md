# Code of Conduct

Michigan State University's policy on diversity and inclusion states: "At MSU we take great pride in our diversity. Valuing inclusion means providing all who live, learn, and work at the university the opportunity to actively participate in a vibrant, intellectual community that offers a broad range of ideas and perspectives. To benefit from our campusâ€™ diversity, we must embrace the opportunity to learn from each other. At MSU we welcome a full spectrum of experiences, viewpoints, and intellectual approaches because it enriches the conversation and benefits everyone, even as it challenges us to grow and think differently."

The Zipkin Lab is dedicated to maintaining an inclusive culture. We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that each lab member and collaborator has a positive educational and working experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in a Zipkin Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all time.

We ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct:

* Be kind to others and behave professionally.

* All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. 

* Be inclusive and create a supportive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute.

* NOTE: Your work in this lab will be publicly available and recorded permanently on github. Please conduct yourself accordingly.

The Zipkin Lab is dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone. Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated.
