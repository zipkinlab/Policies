# So you are new to the Zipkin Lab... Now what?!

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to new lab members. The guidance is meant to be fairly general and there may be additional tasks for specific members to do (i.e., graduate students will need to register for class). Note to lab members: this document is a work in progress and may be updated at any time. Please take the time to make update as you discover the advice is out of date.

## Join the lab listserv
As you are about to join the lab, please email Elise (ezipkin@msu.edu) so that she can add you to the lab listserv.  Sometimes the MSU email accounts give us trouble, so please send both your MSU email and a backup email (preferably gmail).

## Join the lab GitHub
Email your GitHub username to one of the lab GitHub managers (Kayla - davisk93@msu.edu, Wendy - leuenbe9@msu.edu, Bruna - bamaral@msu.edu). 

## Join the lab Teams
Email your netID (MSU email) to the lab Teams manager (Wendy - leuenbe9@msu.edu).

## Get your MSU ID
[I think you need to go to the international center. Is that still the case?]

## Meet the IBIO Staff and get your keys to the lab
It is definitely useful to know the staff in the department and each of their roles.  They help with everything!  IBIO's main office is located in room 203 NatSci. In the main office, you can pick up your key to the lab (located in room 305 NatSci) and get your MSU ID card activated to get into the building after hours.  You will need $10 as a deposit for each key that you need. You will get this money back when you return the key.

## Join EEB
Both postdocs and graduate students are eligible to join the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior program. (Graduate students who join receive a dual degree in IBIO and EEB.) It is a great way to get connected to the community and meet colleagues.  EEB also offers funding opportunities including travel grants. Go to the [EEB website](https://eeb.msu.edu/) or contact Barbara Bloemmers, the EEB secretary, for more information.

## Get an HPCC account
HPCC (High performance computer center; super-computer) accounts are available for all MSU affiliated people. Check out this website if you think you'll be using it: [https://icer.msu.edu/users/getting-started](https://icer.msu.edu/users/getting-started). Elise will need to request the account for you.
